# LAMP & AWS Resources circa April 2012

##This is the readme for the LAMP Resources minisite

This was just a place I collected a bunch of information I was gathering.

The reasons for doing this...

  * Had to hand cod the HTML on the fly
  * I really needed to learn this stuff
  * it gave me an excuse to make a list in markdown


## Markdown?

Markdown is this tedious, inelegant way to tag *'html-like'* information very quickly. It just fucking works
and it has become somewhat ubuquitous for developers. It seems like there should be a better way.
Right now, there's just markdown. [Here is a good cheatsheet on markdown.](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

See what I did there? That was a link ... without an <a href=""> tag... How? ... Markdown.

* _Trying italics with **underscores**_
* *Same thing but with __asterisks__*
* ~~Strike me through!~~
